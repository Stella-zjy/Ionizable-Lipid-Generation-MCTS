## docker
since I have not been able (so far) to reproduce the environment by the original repo, I have made a docker image that can be pulled like this: <br>
`docker pull alexatrise/molgpka`<br>
You will have to have (obviously) docker installed.
Run and enter the image, under the Home you will find the MolGpKa folder from github.
