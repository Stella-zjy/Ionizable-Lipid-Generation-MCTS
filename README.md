# Generative Model for Synthesizing Ionizable Lipids: A Monte Carlo Tree Search Approach

## About the Project
This project presents Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based generative models designed to create novel ionizable lipids with synthetic feasibility and desirable biomedical properties. This research is based on my Master’s thesis: Generative Models for Synthesizable Lipids, supervised by Professor José Miguel Hernández-Lobato at the University of Cambridge.

This project has been accepted to the NeurIPS 2024 AI for New Drug Modalities Workshop.
